# Multiple Facility Calendar

Multiple Facility Calendar is an ASP.NET Core MVC app that will allow a user to create a calendar that lists the open/close hours of multiple facilities or services on the selected date. The goal of this project is to provide a web-based solution for any organization that has multiple facilities with irregular or changing open/close hours that need to be made visible to other users.
